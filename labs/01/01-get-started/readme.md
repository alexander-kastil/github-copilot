# Getting started

## Open this repository in GitHub Codespaces

GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to code directly from your browser or VS Code without local setup. It provides a fully configured environment with all dependencies pre-installed, so you can start coding within seconds. Our environment is defined in [devcontainer.json](/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json).

You can access Codespaces from your browser, VS Code, or the GitHub CLI, making it easy to work from any device.

To launch this repository in GitHub Codespaces, click the button below:

This will open the repository in a cloud-based IDE where you can immediately start working with GitHub Copilot for AI-powered code suggestions. The environment is pre-configured with all necessary tools and extensions.
