# Getting Started

To avoid problems with saved credentials I recommend using an alternate browser or log of all accounts in your browser before starting the lab.

- [Get the Azure Pass Voucher from the GoDeploy Lab](../09-godeploy-lab)

- [Activate and use your Lab Host](../06-lab-host/)

- [Activate your Azure Pass Voucher to create your Azure Subscription](../05-azure-pass) to create a subscription with free grants

- [Register an Azure DevOps Organization](../07-azure-devops)

- Configure Git on the Lab VM and clone the class repo

## Configure Git on the lab host and clone the class repo

- [Register a Github User Account](https://github.com/) or use your existing account

- Clone Class Repo:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/alexander-kastil/az-400
    ```
