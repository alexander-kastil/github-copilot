# Content Moderation using Azure AI Content Safety

- `moderate-text.py` is a Python script that uses the Azure AI Content Safety to moderate text. The script reads text from a file and sends it to the Azure AI Content Safety for moderation. The script then prints the results to the console.

- Our scenario is that we have been given this script and now have the task to check if it works as expected. We will run the script and provide feedback on its functionality.
