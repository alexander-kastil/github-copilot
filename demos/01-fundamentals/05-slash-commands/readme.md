# Slash Commands

Slash commands provide quick shortcuts for common tasks in GitHub Copilot Chat, allowing you to focus your questions and get targeted assistance without typing full natural language prompts. These commands enable you to perform specific operations like explaining code, generating documentation, fixing bugs, and optimizing performance with a simple forward slash followed by a command keyword.

Available in VS Code, GitHub.com, and JetBrains IDEs, slash commands streamline your workflow by routing your intent directly to the most appropriate AI capabilities. Use them in chat to complement natural language queries, or combine them with code selection for context-aware assistance.
