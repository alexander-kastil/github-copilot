# Prompts with Samples

Learn how to write effective prompts by providing Copilot with concrete examples. This approach improves code generation quality by demonstrating the desired pattern or behavior through sample inputs and outputs.

The [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/) provides comprehensive best practices for crafting prompts across different use cases. The [Prompting Workshop](https://microsoft.github.io/Workshop-Interact-with-OpenAI-models/) offers hands-on training from Microsoft on interacting with OpenAI models and optimizing prompt effectiveness.

## Demos

JavaScript — [prompts.js](01-java-script/prompts.js) demonstrates prompt-based code generation with sample data structures, showing how to use comments with example fields to guide Copilot toward creating correctly formatted objects and arrays.

Python — [greetings.py](02-python/greetings.py) uses examples and input/output comments to show Copilot how to generate time-based greeting logic, illustrating how contextual examples improve code generation accuracy.
