# Cloud Agents

Cloud agents execute in remote Azure Container Apps environments, offloading resource-intensive work from your local machine. Execution is asynchronous, keeping your editor responsive while the agent works independently. This model is designed for large-scale tasks, parallel operations, and resource-intensive workloads.

| Aspect           | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Best For         | Large-scale refactoring, parallel tasks, resource-intensive workloads, team consistency, and when tasks exceed local resources. Strengths: scalable resources, no local impact, consistent environments, long-running tasks, coordinate with local/background agents |
| Integration      | Clean, isolated container; configurable compute resources; requires explicit setup of credentials and network access                                                                                                                                                 |
| Parallelism      | Multiple cloud agents can run simultaneously                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Auth Context     | Limited; does not inherit local auth. Credentials must be explicitly passed or configured in container environment                                                                                                                                                   |
| Online Resources | Depends on configuration; typically supports cloud resources with proper setup of credentials and network access                                                                                                                                                     |
| Limitations      | Network latency, container startup overhead, requires Azure setup, significant overhead for short tasks                                                                                                                                                              |
