# Scaffolding Projects

## Scaffold a new Next.js project

```prompt
Create a basic markdown editor in Next.js with the following features:
- Use react hooks
- Create state for markdown with default text "type markdown here"
- A text area where users can write markdown
- Show a live preview of the markdown text as I type
- Support for basic markdown syntax like headers, bold, italics
- Use React markdown npm package
- The markdown text and resulting HTML should be saved in the component's state and updated in real time
```

### Scaffold a Typescript project using webpack

```bash
@workspace /new typescript project with a password validator class requiring a length of 6 chars. add webpack configuration and reference the bundle in index.html. add an input to enter the password and a submit button. write the output to a div in index.html
```
